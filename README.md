# Public Assets
All public assets including ones made by me OR others that made their work public
# Credits Info
All folders with assets in them have a .md file for credits and info on how you can use the assets
nothing in any folder is private which means in most cases just dont re-sell the assets in any way
any assets by me are MIT which means do anything you like with it 
read the .md files please
